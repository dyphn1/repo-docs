**The Fix**: Use `/{skill-name}` to {briefly describe the solution workflow}.

---

## Skills Directory

{List the skills grouped by their categories. For each category, emphasize workflow dependencies or sequential requirements.}

### {Category 1: e.g., Engineering}

{1-2 sentences summarizing what this category of skills does.}

> **Workflow & Dependencies**:
> - **Required Setup**: {e.g., Run `/setup-project` before using any other skills in this category.}
> - **Suggested Flow**: {e.g., Use `/to-prd` to design -> `/to-issues` to split tasks -> `/tdd` to implement.}
